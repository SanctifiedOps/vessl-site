VESSL LANDING PAGE – CODEX MASTER INSTRUCTIONS (React + Vite + TypeScript, CSS-only)
Project: VESSL Fitness App Landing Page Funnel
Repo: Vite + React 19 + TypeScript, package name: vessl-site
Primary goal: Mobile-first conversion page that lets ad traffic choose a subscription tier (3-tier pricing) and complete a simple “checkout intent” flow (no real payments yet).

============================================================
1) NON-NEGOTIABLE OUTCOME
============================================================
Build a premium, Apple iOS-style landing page with subtle motion and a clear funnel:
- Visitor arrives from Facebook/Instagram ads.
- Page immediately communicates: what VESSL is, why it matters, and how it works.
- Visitor can compare 3 plans and choose a tier.
- Selecting a plan opens a lightweight “Get Started” form (email + optional name) and confirms plan selection.
- On submit: show success state and store selection locally (for now). Provide clear TODO hooks for Stripe later.

Requirements:
- Mobile-first UX (must look excellent on iPhone width 360–430px).
- CSS-only styling (no Tailwind). Use a single global stylesheet or CSS Modules (choose ONE and be consistent).
- Use the provided assets located in /src/assets:
  - vessl-logo.svg
  - vessl-fav.svg
- Use tasteful, minimal, premium animations:
  - CSS transitions for hovers and focus states.
  - CSS keyframes for ambient background gradient movement.
  - Optional tiny particle effect via CSS (no heavy canvas).
  - Respect prefers-reduced-motion.

Do NOT:
- Do not refactor unrelated repo files.
- Do not add heavy animation libraries.
- Do not introduce backend code.
- Do not create complex routing; keep this as a single-page landing funnel.

============================================================
2) BRAND & POSITIONING (COPY RULES)
============================================================
Brand name: VESSL
Straplines:
- Primary: “Strength in Motion”
- Secondary CTA theme: “Be The First”

Brand personality:
- Minimalist, strong, structured, science-based.
- No hype, no gimmicks, no transformation-bait.
- Calm confidence. Short sentences. Clear benefits.

Target audience (B2C):
- Beginners & intermediates who need structure.
- Busy professionals who need efficient, realistic workouts.
- People returning from injury who want mobility-first strength progression.

Tone:
- Direct, modern, supportive.
- Avoid slang-heavy gym culture.
- Keep it human and grounded.

============================================================
3) PAGE IA (SECTION ORDER) – MOBILE FIRST
============================================================
Single page with anchored sections. Proposed order:

A) Sticky Top Bar
- Left: VESSL logo
- Right: CTA button “Choose your plan” (scrolls to pricing)
- On scroll: background blur + subtle border, iOS-style.

B) Hero (above the fold)
- Headline: Strength in Motion
- Subheadline: Structured training that fits real life. Build strength, move better, stay consistent.
- Primary CTA: “Choose your plan” (scroll)
- Secondary CTA: “Be The First” (opens email capture modal or scrolls to form section)
- Supporting micro-copy: “Launching soon. Founding pricing available.”
- Visual: abstract iOS-style “device glass card” mock (CSS-only) + moving gradient background.

C) Social Proof / Trust Row
- Use placeholder proof that is honest and non-fabricated:
  - “Built for consistency, not chaos.”
  - “Structured programmes, clear progression.”
  - “Beginner-friendly, scalable sessions.”
Do NOT invent fake stats (no “10k users” etc).
Optionally use icon bullets.

D) How It Works (3 steps)
1. Pick your plan
2. Choose your focus (strength, mobility, conditioning)
3. Follow the programme, track progress

E) Benefits Grid (cards)
- “Programmes that progress”
- “Sessions that fit your week”
- “Mobility-first strength”
- “Simple tracking, real momentum”

F) Built For (audience cards)
- Busy professionals
- Beginners building confidence
- Injury comeback / longevity

G) App Preview (placeholder)
- Section title: “A training system you can actually stick to.”
- Two-column on desktop, stacked on mobile.
- Add 2–3 “feature chips” (e.g., “On-demand sessions”, “Programmes”, “Progress tracking”).
- Use a CSS “phone frame” with placeholder screens (simple rectangles), and a TODO comment for real screenshots.

H) Pricing Table (3 tiers) – CONVERSION CORE
- Must be very readable on mobile.
- Include monthly toggle only if it won’t add complexity. If included, default to monthly.
- One plan marked “Most Popular” (middle tier).
- Each plan has:
  - Name
  - Price per month
  - Short description
  - Included bullets
  - CTA: “Choose [Tier]”
- When user clicks a plan:
  - Highlight it visually.
  - Smooth scroll to “Get Started” form.
  - Pre-fill the chosen plan in the form UI.

I) Get Started Form (simple)
Fields:
- Email (required)
- First name (optional)
- Hidden: chosen plan
Action:
- On submit: validate email format; store {email,firstName,plan,timestamp} to localStorage and to console.log.
- Show success message and “What happens next” text:
  - “We’ll email you launch access and founding pricing.”
- Include a privacy micro-line: “No spam. Unsubscribe anytime.” (no legal claims beyond that).

J) FAQ (objections)
6–8 concise questions:
- “Is VESSL for beginners?”
- “What equipment do I need?”
- “Can I train around an old injury?”
- “How long are sessions?”
- “Can I cancel anytime?”
- “When do I get access?”

K) Final CTA (bottom)
- Headline: “Be The First.”
- Button: “Choose your plan”
- Secondary: “Join the waitlist” (scroll to form)
- Footer: minimal links and copyright.

============================================================
4) PRICING MODEL (DEFAULT – EDITABLE)
============================================================
Use GBP pricing (can be easily changed later). “Founding pricing” to reduce commitment.

Tier 1: STARTER
- £9.99 / month
- Best for: getting consistent
Includes:
- Full on-demand workout library
- Beginner-friendly programmes
- Weekly scheduling guidance
CTA: “Choose Starter”

Tier 2: PROGRESS (Most Popular)
- £14.99 / month
- Best for: structured progression
Includes:
- Everything in Starter
- Structured progression tracks (strength/mobility/conditioning)
- Progress tracking (check-ins, streaks)
CTA: “Choose Progress”

Tier 3: COACH
- £24.99 / month
- Best for: deeper support
Includes:
- Everything in Progress
- Personalised plan inputs (questionnaire, preferences)
- Priority support / feedback channel (placeholder)
CTA: “Choose Coach”

Note: Do not imply 1:1 coaching unless confirmed. Use careful wording: “priority support” not “private coach”.
Add a small line under pricing: “Prices may change after launch. Founding members keep founding rate.”

============================================================
5) DESIGN SYSTEM (CSS TOKENS) – USE EXACT PALETTE
============================================================
Palette (must be implemented as CSS variables):
- Charcoal Black: #1D1D1D
- Off-White Mist: #E8EAE8
- Core Teal: #4CA5A5
- Pale Aqua: #98DAD8
- Deep Ocean Grey: #2C393A

Design style:
- Premium iOS “glass” aesthetic: frosted cards, subtle borders, soft shadows.
- High whitespace, clear hierarchy, large headings.
- Buttons: rounded, high-contrast, with micro-interactions.
- Avoid loud gradients; keep movement subtle.

Typography:
- Use a system font stack for iOS-like feel:
  font-family: ui-sans-serif, system-ui, -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, "Segoe UI", Roboto, Inter, Arial, sans-serif;
- Type scale:
  - Hero H1: clamp(2.2rem, 5vw, 3.25rem)
  - H2: clamp(1.5rem, 3vw, 2.1rem)
  - Body: 1rem–1.05rem with 1.5–1.7 line-height
- Letter spacing: slightly tightened on headings.

Layout:
- Max width: 1120px
- Gutters: 16px mobile, 24px tablet, 32px desktop
- Sections padding: 56–88px vertical depending on screen.

Accessibility:
- Focus styles visible (outline).
- Contrast: teal on dark must be readable.
- Add prefers-reduced-motion handling to disable background animations and scroll reveals.

============================================================
6) MOTION SPEC (CSS-ONLY)
============================================================
Ambient background:
- Use a pseudo-element on the body or hero with a slow-moving gradient animation.
- Add subtle “particles” using CSS (e.g., radial-gradient dots) with slow drift.
- Keep CPU usage low.

Micro-interactions:
- Buttons: translateY(-1px) on hover, active state push in.
- Cards: border + shadow lift on hover (desktop only).
- Pricing selection: smooth highlight and checkmark.

Scroll behavior:
- Smooth scroll to anchors.
- Optional: simple CSS-based reveal using intersection observer in React (tiny custom hook OK). Keep minimal.

Reduced motion:
- If prefers-reduced-motion: reduce, disable keyframes and reveals.

============================================================
7) IMPLEMENTATION PLAN (FILES TO CREATE / EDIT)
============================================================
Do this in small, safe steps. Keep diffs clear.

A) Update favicon and document head
- Edit index.html to reference /src/assets/vessl-fav.svg as favicon.
- Set title: “VESSL | Strength in Motion”
- Meta description: concise fitness platform positioning.
- Add viewport already present (verify).

B) Component structure (recommended)
- /src/components/
  - StickyNav.tsx
  - Hero.tsx
  - TrustRow.tsx
  - HowItWorks.tsx
  - Benefits.tsx
  - Audience.tsx
  - AppPreview.tsx
  - Pricing.tsx
  - GetStartedForm.tsx
  - FAQ.tsx
  - Footer.tsx

C) State handling
- In App.tsx, manage selectedPlan state:
  type PlanId = "starter" | "progress" | "coach";
  const [selectedPlan,setSelectedPlan] = useState<PlanId | null>(null);

- Pricing section calls setSelectedPlan(planId) and scrolls to form.
- Form reads selectedPlan and shows it clearly.

D) CSS approach (choose ONE):
Option 1 (preferred): /src/styles/global.css and import it in main.tsx.
- Define :root CSS variables.
- Build reusable utility classes (container, section, glassCard, button, etc).
- Avoid too many one-off styles.

Option 2: CSS Modules per component (more files). If you pick this, be consistent.

E) Animation CSS
- Implement keyframes in global.css
- Apply only to hero background and a few accents.
- Keep it subtle.

F) Data placeholders
- Create a plans constant with name, price, bullets.
- FAQ array with questions/answers.

============================================================
8) CODING STYLE RULES (DO NOT VIOLATE)
============================================================
TypeScript + React rules:
- Use function components with arrow functions and parentheses around params: const X = ({...}:{...}) => {...}
- Keep object braces tight in code where reasonable (minimal spaces) to match existing preference.
- Keep components small and readable.
- Do not add dependencies unless absolutely necessary.
- No console noise except for the intentional submit log.

Forms:
- Simple validation only.
- Clear error messages.
- Disable submit while “submitting” (simulate with short timeout optional).

============================================================
9) COPY BLOCKS (READY TO USE)
============================================================
Hero:
H1: Strength in Motion
Sub: A structured training system built for real life. Programmes that progress, sessions you can actually stick to.
Primary CTA: Choose your plan
Secondary CTA: Be The First
Micro: Launching soon. Founding members get founding pricing.

Trust row:
- Structured programmes
- Mobility-first strength
- Built for consistency

How it works:
- Pick your plan
- Choose your focus
- Build momentum, track progress

Pricing descriptions:
Starter: Start strong with simple structure.
Progress: The full system for consistent progress.
Coach: Extra guidance, faster clarity.

Form:
Title: Get started
Helper: Choose your plan, drop your email, and we’ll send launch access.
Success title: You’re in.
Success body: We’ll email you when VESSL opens, with your founding pricing.

============================================================
10) ACCEPTANCE CHECKLIST (WHAT “DONE” MEANS)
============================================================
- Page loads with VESSL logo and correct favicon.
- Mobile-first: no horizontal scrolling, no cramped sections.
- Motion feels premium, not gimmicky.
- Pricing selection works, plan highlights, scrolls to form.
- Form validates email, shows errors, stores submission to localStorage.
- All sections present and styled consistently with palette.
- Prefers-reduced-motion disables animations.
- Lighthouse performance is reasonable (no huge images, no heavy scripts).

============================================================
11) TODO HOOKS (FUTURE INTEGRATIONS, DO NOT IMPLEMENT NOW)
============================================================
- Stripe checkout / subscriptions
- Email provider integration (Mailchimp / Klaviyo)
- Analytics (Meta pixel, GA4)
- Real app screenshots and video
